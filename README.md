# 🔁 n8nflow

> 🚀 Turn natural language prompts into real, working [n8n](https://n8n.io) workflows — powered by AI.

**n8nflow** is a free, open-source Chrome extension that adds an AI assistant directly into the n8n UI. Just describe your automation in plain English — and watch it become a live n8n workflow in seconds.

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🧾 Accepts prompts like:  
  > *"Send an email to every client in a Google Sheet every Monday at 9am"*

- 🧠 Uses **OpenAI** or **Gemini** to convert the prompt into a working n8n workflow (not just JSON)

- 💻 Injects a floating AI chat inside your **n8n instance** (UI-level)

- 📥 Outputs a ready-to-import JSON or auto-builds the workflow live in the editor

- 🆓 100% open-source, free forever
